# TSP_Sedena

Project for the Intelligent Systems class...

## Requirements

```
Python3
Pandas (pip3 install pandas)
```

Please don't forget to use Python3...

You shouldn't be using Python3 anyways...

hopefully..?

## Overview

"Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point." Sounds familiar? Of course it does!

The goal is to have an environment to visualize the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), after solving the problem for n cities using a genetic algorithm.

This project will also contain a brute force search which will be a DFS in order to compare different cases using our algorithm and mutation/breeding heuristics.

## Usage

To run:
```
chmod +x ./TSP.py
./TSP.py --genetic
./TSP.py --brute
```
